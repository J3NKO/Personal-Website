Personal-Website

This is the main code bade behind my portfolio website. It is a node.js application hosted on Heroku. There is a simple architecture to this website with no database needed, I used a primary JS file named Server.js to do most of the heavy lifting which incorporates the Express.js Framework in order to configure the server, serve the files and create my relavant routes. Then I used the nodemailer Library to set up my SMTP posting.
